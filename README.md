# Manage your email in ChatGPT ‚úâÔ∏èü¶ú

**UPDATE (14/05/2024):**

I'm working on framework for [serving Python notebooks as web applications](https://runmercury.com). Recently, we have added option to execute Python notebook as REST API. Thanks to this, notebooks can be easily used in the ChatGPT builder as actions. I wrote example of [custom action for sending emails from ChatGPT](https://runmercury.com/use/gpt-builder-action-send-email/).

**UPDATE (03/06/2024):**

I turned off server with mail4gpt.com so schema in readme is not working.

Wouldn't it be fantastic if you could access your email in ChatGPT?

It is possible! 

This project introduces a novel integration of email management capabilities into ChatGPT via a custom REST API server. It is specifically designed to augment the functionality of custom GPTs, enabling them to handle email tasks efficiently within the ChatGPT environment.

This server makes access to **only one** email address. It should be configured in `.env` file. See details below. This server gives access to email reading/sending by auth token that is created when server is starting. 

[Here](https://api.mail4gpt.com/schema/swagger-ui/) is Swagger UI with endpoints docs.

Below is an example chat with email enabled. The chat history is available at https://chat.openai.com/share/8542aae6-74d7-47d3-bf2c-8f0c022985c3
